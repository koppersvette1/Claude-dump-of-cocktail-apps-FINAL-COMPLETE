- **Intelligent Recipe Generation**: AI-powered recipe suggestions based on inventory
- **Smart Substitutions**: Ingredient swap suggestions using flavor profiles
- **Pairing Suggestions**: Food and wood pairings for cocktails
- **Settings & Preferences**: Toggle alcohol/mocktails/kids drinks, smoker availability, font size
- **Step-by-step Instructions**: Detailed recipe guidance with variants (standard, swap, mocktail, kid-friendly)
